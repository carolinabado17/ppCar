# Car Design
Designing a program using object-oriented programming to design a car and its features.<br />
This project was for COP 3003- Object-Oriented Programming with Professor Vanselow. It was part of a personal project assigment for Fall 2019.

## History

10/20 - Worked on the interfaces Chassis and Feature <br />
10/27 - Implemented the Chassis interface into VehicleChassis() and VehicleFrame()<br />
11/10 - Created the Engine interfaces and implemented it to ManufacturedEngine()<br />
11/24 - Implemented both Engine and Chassis to class Vehicle()<br />
12/1 - Implemented Feature into both ExteriorFeature() and InteriorFeature() <br />
12/8 - Finished the program by extending class Vehicle() to class Car()<br />

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

Interfaces - its basically a 'contract' *NOT* a blueprint like a class. Used to be able to implement to multiple classes in my program. <br />
Abstract class - class in which you are unable to create an object. This was used to to extends Vehicle to Car becaue these two are somewhat related. (A car is a vehicle)
